    <p>The <strong>noopener</strong>: The <strong>noopener</strong> value of the rel attribute ensures that a link
        opened in a new tab or window cannot
        interact with
        or access the original page. Without it, the new page can use JavaScript to manipulate the original page, which
        poses a
        security risk.</p>


    <p>Without noopener, the new tab could use JavaScript to interact with the original page, which is unsafe.
        <strong>noreferrer</strong>: The <strong>noreferrer</strong> value of the rel attribute provides both privacy
        and security. It prevents the new page from knowing where the user came from (hiding the referrer) and also
        includes the behavior of noopener, preventing the new page from accessing the original page.
    </p>

    <p>The prevention of access that is caused by <strong>noopener</strong> prevents phishing attacks where the opened
        link may change the
        original webpage to a different one to trick users. This is referred to as tabnabbing. Adding the
        <strong>noreferrer</strong> value can be done if you wish to not let the opened link know that your webpage
        links to it. <strong>NOTE:</strong> Nevertheless, in line with good coding practices and to err on the side of
        caution, it is recommended to always pair a
        <strong>target="_blank"</strong> with a <strong>rel="noopener noreferrer".</strong>
