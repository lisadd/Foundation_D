Hello to Odin.  Thank you for your contribution to the betterment of others.

I simple google search, reveals the following details.
"Erik Trautman founded The Odin Project in 2013. Currently it is maintained and continually improved by a team of volunteers many of whom learned to code with us"

In the interim, I will spend time doing the needed, as it appears the "carrot" exist one day more... how long will you prevail. Not forever. 

Time to enjoy the ride and see where this all takes me. May joy and excellence be our guide. :) 


The goal of this project is to illustrate mine and others, diligence to learning, commitment to getting the work done and willingness to build the foundation, like those who came before me. May we all succeed!
